# Invoice App

This is a simple invoicing app help freelancers keep track of their invoices.

### Purpose and Goal

The goal was to be able to build quite a complete web application aside the normal websites I've leant to build and to solidify my understanding of state management in redux and animations in React.

## Features

- Create/edit invoices
- Filter paid, pending or draft invoices
- Theme switching

## Built with

- React
- Redux
- Material UI
- Framer Motion

## Problems and New stuff learned

As with many dev projects, I had to battle and overcome a few challenges. Key among these were:

- figuring out to apply validation to form and provide the option to skip the validation when saving a draft.
- building a multilevel dropdown menu
